 🧩 System Overview:
    This is a simple Object-Oriented Programming project that shows 4 different musical instruments and their types as well as their personalities:
       🎸 Marcin (Guitar)
       🎻 Violin
       🎺 Flute
       🎸 Ukelele
    Each is represented as a class that inherits from the abstract base class **Musical_Instrument**. Showcasing OOP principles like abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
        Abstraction - **Musical_Instrument** defines the required methods, but does not implement them.
        Inheritance - **Guitar**, **Violin**, **Flute**, and **Ukelele** inherit from **Musical_Instrument**.
        Polymorphism - Each instrument class has its own behavior for **play()**, **tune()**, and **description()**
        
💻 How to run the program:
    1. Choose any instrument out of the 4 available instruments:
        🎸 Marcin (Guitar): Choose a brand and his personality (Acoustic/Electric/Neither)
        🎻 Violin: Enter its name and brand
        🎺 Flute: Provide its name, material (optional), and key (optional)
        🎸 Ukelele: Name it, choose brand and size (optional)
    2. Interact with your instrument:
        Introduce: Hear its intro
        Play: Listen to its unique tune
        Tune: Simulate tuning it
        Stop: End the interaction
    3. Go back to explore other instrument or exit when ready.

    This OOP project was created as part of our Advanced Computer Programming course. We thank our professor for the guidance and
for helping us understand the key OOP concepts. Special thanks to our team members for their cooperation and their effort for the project.
